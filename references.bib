abstract = {A methodological problem is inherent in any discussion of extraterrestrial engineering and its detectability: how to distinguish detection signatures of such astroengineering from “natural”, non-intentional, albeit exotic, processes? In practice, searches for traces and manifestations of advanced technological civilizations have been reduced so far to searching for outliers in the allegedly well-known regularities expected from natural astrophysical sources. This procedure, however, is an epistemological minefield, for at least two reasons: (i) prior datasets on which the regularities are based might be contaminated by artefacts, and (ii) the procedure of computation of unobservable quantities usually contains the implicit assumption of the non-intentional nature of sources. In other words, we are facing a Catch-22-type problem: in order to prove the artificial nature of a source, we seemingly need to first assume that it is not artificial. In contrast to most problems in science, this one could possibly be aggravated, rather than reduced, with the progress of our scientific understanding. Some possible recourses, as well as directions for further work toward building a comprehensive methodology of the Dysonian SETI, are discussed.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {With "Earth 2000" technology we could generate a directed laser pulse that outshines the broadband visible light of the Sun by 4 orders of magnitude. This is a conservative lower bound for the technical capability of a communicating civilization; optical interstellar communication is thus technically plausible. We have built a pair of systems to detect nanosecond pulsed optical signals from a target list that includes some 13,000 Sun-like stars, and we have made some 16,000 observations totaling nearly 2400 hr during five years of operation. A beam splitter-fed pair of hybrid avalanche photodetectors at the 1.5 m Wyeth Telescope at the Harvard/Smithsonian Oak Ridge Observatory (Agassiz Station) triggers on a coincident pulse pair, initiating measurement of pulse width and intensity at subnanosecond resolution. An identical system at the 0.9 m Cassegrain at Princeton's Fitz-Randolph Observatory performs synchronized observations with 0.1 μs event timing, permitting unambiguous identification of even a solitary pulse. Among the 11,600 artifact-free observations at Harvard, the distribution of 274 observed events shows no pattern of repetition, and is consistent with a model with uniform event rate, independent of target. With one possible exception (HIP 107395), no valid event has been seen simultaneously at the two observatories. We describe the search and candidate events and set limits on the prevalence of civilizations transmitting intense optical pulses.}

title = {SETI VIA LEAKAGE FROM LIGHT SAILS IN EXOPLANETARY SYSTEMS},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {The primary challenge of rocket propulsion is the burden of needing to accelerate the spacecraft’s own fuel, resulting in only a logarithmic gain in maximum speed as propellant is added to the spacecraft. Light sails offer an attractive alternative in which fuel is not carried by the spacecraft, with acceleration being provided by an external source of light. By artificially illuminating the spacecraft with beamed radiation, speeds are only limited by the area of the sail, heat resistance of its material, and power use of the accelerating apparatus. In this paper, we show that leakage from a light sail propulsion apparatus in operation around a solar system analogue would be detectable. To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave beam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around a single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz. Leakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of Jy and durations of tens of seconds at 100 pc. Because most travel within a planetary system would be conducted between the habitable worlds within that system, multiply transiting exoplanetary systems offer the greatest chance of detection, especially when the planets are in projected conjunction as viewed from Earth. If interplanetary travel via beam-driven light sails is commonly employed in our galaxy, this activity could be revealed by radio follow-up of nearby transiting exoplanetary systems. The expected signal properties define a new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).}

title = {The Pale Green Dot: A Method to Characterize Proxima Centauri b Using Exo-Aurorae},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We examine the feasibility of detecting auroral emission from the potentially habitable exoplanet Proxima Centauri b. Detection of aurorae would yield an independent confirmation of the planet’s existence, constrain the presence and composition of its atmosphere, and determine the planet’s eccentricity and inclination, thereby breaking the mass-inclination degeneracy. If Proxima Centauri b is a terrestrial world with an Earth-like atmosphere and magnetic field, we estimate that the power at the 5577 Å O i auroral line is on the order of 0.1 TW under steady-state stellar wind, or ∼100× stronger than that on Earth. This corresponds to a planet–star contrast ratio of  in a narrow band about the 5577 Å line, though higher contrast () may be possible during periods of strong magnetospheric disturbance (auroral power 1–10 TW). We searched the Proxima Centauri b HARPS data for the 5577 Å line and for other prominent oxygen and nitrogen lines, but find no signal, indicating that the O i auroral line contrast must be lower than  (with power ≲3000 TW), consistent with our predictions. We find that observations of 0.1 TW auroral emission lines are likely infeasible with current and planned telescopes. However, future observations with a space-based coronagraphic telescope or a ground-based extremely large telescope (ELT) with a coronagraph could push sensitivity down to terawatt oxygen aurorae (contrast ) with exposure times of ∼1 day. If a coronagraph design contrast of 10−7 can be achieved with negligible instrumental noise, a future concept ELT could observe steady-state auroral emission in a few nights.}

These lines have been absolute intensity calibrated and measured at a spectral resolution (λ/Δλ) of ∼43,000–45,000. Presented here are spectroscopic identifications for 98\% of the lines in the atlas, made primarily through comparisons with synthetic spectra of prominent OH and O2 nightglow emission systems. The ability to simulate these systems successfully has shown that there are many additional lines that could be added to the atlas. We believe that all the O2 and OH lines in the measured region can now be successfully modeled with an accuracy better than the instrumental spectral resolution.},

journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {We searched high-resolution spectra of 5600 nearby stars for emission lines that are both inconsistent with a natural origin and unresolved spatially, as would be expected from extraterrestrial optical lasers. The spectra were obtained with the Keck 10 m telescope, including light coming from within 0.5 arcsec of the star, corresponding typically to within a few to tens of astronomical units of the star, and covering nearly the entire visible wavelength range from 3640 to 7890 Å. We establish detection thresholds by injecting synthetic laser emission lines into our spectra and blindly analyzing them for detections. We compute flux density detection thresholds for all wavelengths and spectral types sampled. Our detection thresholds for the power of the lasers themselves range from 3 kW to 13 MW, independent of distance to the star but dependent on the competing “glare” of the spectral energy distribution of the star and on the wavelength of the laser light, launched from a benchmark, diffraction-limited 10 m class telescope. We found no such laser emission coming from the planetary region around any of the 5600 stars. Because they contain roughly 2000 lukewarm, Earth-size planets, we rule out models of the Milky Way in which over 0.1% of warm, Earth-size planets harbor technological civilizations that, intentionally or not, are beaming optical lasers toward us. A next-generation spectroscopic laser search will be done by the Breakthrough Listen initiative, targeting more stars, especially stellar types overlooked here including spectral types O, B, A, early F, late M, and brown dwarfs, and astrophysical exotica.}

After fifty years of research, the origin of the dominant green line of wavelength 5577 Å was still a mystery. Only in 1912 did progress finally begin to occur in the understanding of the aurora, a field of research which appealed in particular to Norwegian scientists. Prominent among them was Lars Vegard (1880–1963), who in 1923 suggested a new picture of the upper atmosphere and an explanation of the green line in terms of excitations of frozen nitrogen dust particles. Although apparently confirmed by cryogenic experiments, Vegard's theory was challenged by the Canadian physicist John McLellan (1867–1935) who in 1925, together with his postdoctoral student Gordon Shrum (1896–1985), reproduced the line in experiments with helium-oxygen mixtures. This is the story of how the enigma of the green auroral line was finally resolved and explained by the quantum theory of atoms, namely as a transition between two metastable states of oxygen. It is also the story of two of the period's leading specialists in auroral spectroscopy, their rivalry, and different approaches to the study of the northern light.}",

ABSTRACT = {Bathymetric LiDAR technology is a technology used for simultaneous data acquisition regarding the morphology of the bottom of water reservoirs and the surrounding coastal zone, realized from the air, e.g., by plane or drone. Contrary to the air topographic LiDAR, which uses an infrared wavelength of 1064 nm, bathymetric LiDAR systems additionally use a green wavelength of 532 nm. The green laser can penetrate the water, which makes it possible to measure the depth of shallow water reservoirs, rivers, and coastal sea waters within three Secchi depths. This article presents the theoretical basis for the construction of a green laser. Against the background of other methods of measuring the bottom of water reservoirs, the technology using waves from the visible light range is presented in detail in the assessment of the bottom morphology of shallow water reservoirs. The possibilities of using green laser in lidar bathymetry implemented in particular in non-navigable regions are shown. The results of the researchers&rsquo; work on river processes (erosion, sedimentation), design of stream restoration, determination of morphometric parameters of the riverbed, as well as assessment of the topography of the marine coastal bottom zones are summarized. The development direction of lidar bathymetry is discussed.},

Rayleigh-backscattered light from a slice of the illuminated column, when imaged in a ground-based telescope, produced an image that is essentially identical to that of a natural star. This experiment demonstrates the ease of producing bright and sharply focused laser guide stars at 351 nm. Such laser guide stars are ideal for guiding astronomical telescopes equipped with adaptive optics.},

The kappa distribution provides a straightforward replacement for the Maxwell distribution, that is, a generalization for describing systems characterized by local correlations among their particles, commonly found in space and astrophysical plasmas. The corresponding Voigt profiles are derived by convoluting the thermal and natural/collisional Lorentzian profiles. The kappa velocity distributions are employed to derive the thermal Doppler and Voigt profiles, while the kappa phase-space distributions in the presence of potential fields that depend on the position vector, are used to derive their respective differential profiles. We focus on attractive power-law potentials (oscillation-type, gravitational-type, and angular potentials), and study the variations of the produced Voigt differential profiles in detail. The developed formulations and guidelines provide a useful and statistically well-grounded “toolbox” for future reference in data analyses, simulations, analytical modeling, and theories of spectroscopy and related subjects of space and astrophysical plasmas.}

The search for laser light involved rejecting sharp peaks in the spectrum from stellar flares, fluorescent city lights, and elementary particles that directly hit the CCD detector. The search revealed unexpected spectral ‘combs’ found at equally spaced frequencies, which were not known to the observer nor to the builder of the spectrometer. But they came from stray, optical ghosts of light originating with an interferometric etalon filter and its light source at the telescope. Future observers must be aware of this contamination. The 107 spectra of Proxima Centauri show no evidence of any laser emission nor technological signatures of any type. Of special interest are 29 spectra obtained between March and July 2019 when the candidate technological radio signal, BLC1, was captured by Breakthrough Listen. This search would have revealed laser light from Proxima Centauri pointed toward Earth if the laser had a power at least 20 to 120 kilowatts (depending on wavelength) and was positioned within the 1.3 au field of view, assuming a benchmark laser launcher having a 10-m aperture. Smaller lasers would also have been detected, but would require more power.}",

abstract = {The SERENDIP project is an ongoing program of monitoring and processing broadband radio signals acquired by existing radio astronomy observatories. SERENDIP operates in a piggyback mode: it makes use of whatever observing plan (sequence of frequencies, sky coordinates, and polarizations) is under way at its host observatory. Moreover, the SERENDIP data acquisition system, once installed, operates autonomously. This approach makes it possible to obtain large amounts of high quality observing time in a manner that is economical and that does not adversely affect ongoing radio astronomy survey work. The SERENDIP II system has been installed at the NRAO 300-foot telescope at Green Bank, West Virginia, and has operated there for several thousand hours. In this report, we summarize our findings from these observations and describe the present status of the project. Two key elements of SERENDIP are the automated data acquisition system that uses adaptive thresholds and logs only statistically significant peaks in the real-time power spectra, and the subsequent off-line analysis programs that identify and reject a variety of interference signals. Several specific correlations have been identified that offer promise. At present, the development and testing of these interference rejection algorithms is the main thrust of our work.}

    abstract = {The famous ‘Wow’ signal detected in 1977 remains arguably the most compelling SETI signal ever found. The original Big Ear data require that the signal turned on/off over the span of ∼3 min (time difference between the dual antennae), yet persisted for 72 s (duration of a single beam sweep). Combined with the substantial and negative follow-up efforts, these observations limit the allowed range of signal repeat schedules, to the extent that one might question the credibility of the signal itself. Previous work has largely excluded the hypothesis of a strictly periodic repeating source, for periods shorter than 40 h. However, a non-periodic, stochastic repeater remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ a likelihood emulator using the Big Ear observing logs to infer the probable signal properties under this hypothesis. We find that the maximum a-posteriori solution has a likelihood of 32.3 per cent, highly compatible with the Big Ear data, with a broad 2σ credible interval of signal duration 72 s\&lt;T \&lt; 77 min and mean repeat rate 0.043 d−1 \&lt; λ \&lt; 59.8 d−1. We extend our analysis to include 192 h of subsequent observations from META, Hobart, and ATA, which drops the peak likelihood to 1.78 per cent, and thus in tension with the available data at the 2.4σ level. Accordingly, the Wow signal cannot be excluded as a stochastic repeater with available data, and we estimate that 62 d of accumulated additional observations would be necessary to surpass 3σ confidence.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {In 1977 a search for extraterrestrial intelligence at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory recorded a strong, narrowband, and apparently intermittent emission near the 21 cm hydrogen line. The detection displayed the antenna pattern signature of a transiting celestial radio source but was not repeated in subsequent transit observations. The event has been advanced by some as a candidate interstellar signal and dismissed by others as probable interference; no independent attempt to replicate the event with a spectral resolution comparable to Ohio State's has been reported. We used the Very Large Array to search for a possible underlying source—artificial or natural—which could account for the detection by occasionally brightening because of scintillation, intrinsic variability, or some other mechanism. With a sensitivity greater than 100 times the original observations, we found two continuum sources within the Ohio State coordinate error boxes, but they displayed no unusual spectral features, showed no sign of flux variability, yielded normal spectral indices based on additional observations at 6 cm, and were too weak to account for the Ohio State detection. No narrow-bandwidth point sources were detected over a band of 1.5 MHz to a flux limit of about 20 mJy at the nominal coordinates. We conclude that the "Wow" was not due to a continuous source usually below Ohio State's several jansky detection threshold but occasionally increasing in flux by a factor of less than ~100. Our search does not significantly constrain the possibility of intermittent sources because we dwelled for only 5-22 minutes per field.}

It is proposed that a search for sources of infrared radiation should accompany the recently initiated search for interstellar radio communications.}}

abstract = {Technosignatures refer to observational manifestations of technology that could be detected through astronomical means. Most previous searches for technosignatures have focused on searches for radio signals, but many current and future observing facilities could also constrain the prevalence of some non-radio technosignatures. This search could thus benefit from broader participation by the astronomical community, as contributions to technosignature science can also take the form of negative results that provide statistically meaningful quantitative upper limits on the presence of a signal. This paper provides a synthesis of the recommendations of the 2020 TechnoClimes workshop, which was an online event intended to develop a research agenda to prioritize and guide future theoretical and observational studies technosignatures. The paper provides a high-level overview of the use of current and future missions to detect exoplanetary technosignatures at ultraviolet, optical, or infrared wavelengths, which specifically focuses on the detectability of atmospheric technosignatures, artificial surface modifications, optical beacons, space engineering and megastructures, and interstellar flight. This overview does not derive any new quantitative detection limits but is intended to provide additional science justification for the use of current and planned observing facilities as well as to inspire astronomers conducting such observations to consider the relevance of their ongoing observations to technosignature science. This synthesis also identifies possible technology gaps with the ability of current and planned missions to search for technosignatures, which suggests the need to consider technosignature science cases in the design of future mission concepts.}

abstract = {The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in optical wavelengths has recently concentrated either on detecting intense short light pulses that briefly outshine the background star or on finding unique features that stand out in the star's spectrum. But there is a middle ground available where the temporal variation of an optical SETI source would distinguish it from its stellar background. Initial results are presented for frequency-domain searches, covering a signal range of 1–10,000 Hz, with an instrument that simultaneously measures two broad optical spectral bands. It is shown that signals a thousand times fainter than the background starlight can be detected using this instrument coupled to a meter-class telescope. Since these signals can be either positive or negative (i.e. a periodic obscuration), the intriguing possibility exists of detecting signals where no energy need be intentionally beamed toward Earth.}

abstract = {The near-infrared region offers a compelling window for interstellar communications, energy transfer, and transient detection due to low extinction and low thermal emission from dust. We have conducted a search for near-infrared (950–1650 nm) light pulses having durations less than 50 nanoseconds while observing 1280 astronomical objects which include a wide range of nearby stars, clusters, and galaxies. A field of view of 2.″5 × 2.″5 for a duration of at least 300 s was observed for each object pointing. These observations were made using the latest Near-InfraRed Optical SETI instrumentation on the Nickel telescope (1 m) at Lick Observatory. Equipped with two detectors collecting photons coming from the same part of the sky, the instrument is aimed at detecting light pulses coincident between them within nanoseconds, as well as periodic signals. While we report on a few notifications from our system, we believe these events were consistent with the statistical noise of our data. No significant evidence for repeated near-infrared nanosecond pulsed signal was found, given the instrumental limit in sensitivity of 63 ph m−2 ns−1.}

ISO is the European infrared astronomy mission covering the wavelength region of 2–240 microns. A SETI program using 1h 18m total spacecraft time has been established and will be described. The program will be the first attempt to perform active SETI in the infrared using a spacecraft. A photometric survey, covering 3–60 microns, of several old main sequence stars will be performed in order to assess infrared excesses compatible with the presence of large astro-engineering products like Dyson spheres that emit a blackbody temperature of several hundred K. This survey shall identify candidates for Dyson spheres. In addition, a few objects which are known to show infrared excesses in the 12 or 25 micron IRAS measurements are considered for a detailed photometric investigation. The usage of the ISO satellite is crucial for the success of the program as only ISO currently offers, with its infrared photometer, the high sensitivity that is needed to detect the radiation of cold artificial structures superimposed on the several thousand K blackbody background spectrum of the host star.}

With these two telescopes, we conducted a targeted search of nearly two hundred solar-type stars covering the frequency range from 1.2–3 GHz. The signal detection system described in the paper by Dreher[1]was optimized to detect narrowband signals (presumed to be transmitted by another technological civilization) originating in the vicinity of these targets. The system was sensitive to signals that were continuously present, or pulsed regularly, even if their frequencies drifted, or changed slowly in time. Many signals of precisely this nature were detected—coming from our own technology! All manner of transmitters, from microwave ovens to satellite downlinks, are rapidly making this naturally quiet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum extremely noisy. The use of the two widely separated telescopes as a pseudo-interferometer was essential to discriminate against signals of terrestrial origin. The performance of the system and the results of the observing campaign are presented in this paper, while the cooperative science observations that were undertaken with Australian PIs are described in a companion paper.}

If a relatively small fraction of the nuclear resources present in the crust of a terrestrial-type planet were processed via breeder reactors, the resulting stellar spectrum would be selectively modified over geological time periods provided the star has a sufficiently shallow outer convective zone. Consideration of surface convective mixing and stellar lifetimes restricts the possible candidate stars to the approximate spectra range A5-F2. The abundance anomalies resulting from the slow neutron fission of plutonium-239 and uranium-233 are presented and it is argued that these anomalous distributions are unlikely to be duplicated by natural nucleosynthesis processes. Relative to solar system abundances, the elements praseodymium and neodymium are found to be the most overabundant. These elements, along with the radioactive elements technetium and plutonium, could be used to identify A5-F2 candidate stars in a preliminary spectral survey.}
